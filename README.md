## Threedee
Threedee is an interactive music visualizer combining the Web Audio API and the THREE.js library to create shapes in your browser and make them respond to a song, drag an MP3 or link a song from Soundcloud.

You can check it out here: [Threedee](http://tadx-threedee.herokuapp.com/)

## Toolkit
This website uses Javascript, jQuery, the Web Audio API, THREE.js and the Soundcloud API. The back-end is managed by Rails.

## Todo
- Merge this project with my Soundcloud player website [CloudChaser](https://github.com/xaun/soundcloudplayer). When you search Soundcloud for music, you can switch over to a visualiser!
- Endless aims to improve 3D visuals
- Fix it so the a default visualiser starts when the HTML5 Audio Player starts, its currently silently running in the background forcing high CPU usage.
- Microphone Input
- Live audio source input (Guitar, etc)!!!!!
