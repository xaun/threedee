## Threedee
Threedee is an interactive music visualizer combining the Web Audio API and the THREE.js library to create shapes in your browser and make them respond to a song, drag an MP3 or link a song from Soundcloud.

You can check it out here: tadx-3dsound.herokuapp.com

## Toolkit
This website uses Javascript, jQuery, the Web Audio API, THREE.js and the Soundcloud API. The back-end is managed by Rails.

## Todo
- Merge this project with my Soundcloud player website 'CloudChaser'. When you search Soundcloud for music, you can switch over to a visualiser!
